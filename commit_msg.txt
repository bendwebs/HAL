fix: tell LLM not to render image, add frontend debug logging

1. Updated LLM tool result message to explicitly tell the LLM
   not to try to display the image with markdown - the UI handles it

2. Added console logging to ActionItem component to debug why
   generated images aren't rendering during streaming
