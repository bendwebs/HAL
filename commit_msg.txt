fix: replace all httpx calls with synchronous requests library

httpx async client was causing SD to hang after first request.
Switching entirely to synchronous requests library which works
reliably (as confirmed by manual curl tests working fine).

- Removed httpx import
- Changed check_availability, get_progress, get_models, get_samplers
- Simplified generate_image to use direct requests.post
- Removed auto-restart logic (shouldn't be needed now)
