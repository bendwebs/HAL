fix: pass --api as command line argument instead of env var

The COMMANDLINE_ARGS environment variable is only used for logging,
not for actually passing arguments. webui.bat uses %* to pass args
to launch.py.

Updated run_api.bat to:
- Call webui.bat --api (passes --api through to launch.py)
- Removed --nowebui since --api alone enables the API alongside UI

This should properly enable the SD API endpoint.
