fix: make generated image serving endpoint public

Removed authentication requirement from the image serving endpoint.
This allows images to be displayed in <img> tags without needing
auth headers (which browsers can't add to img src requests).

Security is maintained through:
- User ID in path (24-char MongoDB ObjectId)
- UUID-based filenames that are unguessable
- Path traversal validation
