feat: organize generated images by user for privacy

Images are now stored in user-specific directories:
  data/generated_images/{user_id}/filename.png

Changes:
- stable_diffusion_service.py:
  - Added user_id parameter to generate_image() and img2img()
  - Created _get_user_output_dir() helper
  - URLs now include user_id: /api/images/generated/{user_id}/{filename}

- images.py router:
  - Updated endpoint to /generated/{user_id}/{filename}
  - Added access control - users can only view their own images
  - Added GET /my-images endpoint to list user's generated images
  - Added DELETE /generated/{filename} to delete own images

- agent_system.py:
  - Pass user_id to generate_image() call

This ensures users' generated images are private and organized.
