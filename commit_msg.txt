fix: add retry logic when model fails to call generate_image tool

The qwen2.5:7b model sometimes hallucinates that it generated an
image without actually calling the tool. This adds a retry mechanism
similar to the one for youtube_search - if the user's message looks
like an image request but the model doesn't call the tool, we retry
with a hint to force tool usage.
