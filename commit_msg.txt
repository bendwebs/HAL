fix: use curl subprocess for ALL SD API calls

Since manual curl commands work reliably with SD but Python HTTP
libraries (httpx, aiohttp, requests) all cause hangs after the
first request, switch entirely to curl subprocess calls.

- Added _curl_get helper method for GET requests
- Converted check_availability, get_progress, get_models, get_samplers
- Converted generate_image to use synchronous subprocess.run
- Removed requests import
