fix: create dedicated API launcher script for SD

The previous approach of setting COMMANDLINE_ARGS via environment
variable didn't work because webui-user.bat explicitly resets it.

New approach: Create a dedicated launcher script (run_api.bat) that:
1. Calls environment.bat to set up paths
2. Sets COMMANDLINE_ARGS=--api --nowebui BEFORE calling webui.bat
3. This ensures the API flag is properly passed

The launcher is created automatically in the SD directory on first use.
For portable installs: creates run_api.bat
For standard installs: creates webui-api.bat
