fix: pass full generated_image result to frontend

The action_complete handler was only passing full structured data
for youtube_results, but extracting just result.get("result") for
other tools - which doesn't exist for generated_image.

Now both youtube_results and generated_image types pass their full
result object to the frontend, allowing proper image rendering.
