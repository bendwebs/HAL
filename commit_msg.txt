fix: show tool running status during SD startup

Problems fixed:
1. Frontend wasn't handling 'action_start' event - user saw no feedback
2. 'action_complete' was adding duplicate actions instead of updating

Changes:
- chat/[id]/page.tsx: Added action_start handler to show tool as running
- chat/[id]/page.tsx: action_complete now updates existing action by ID
- sd_process_manager.py: Log every 10s instead of 15s for better feedback
- agent_system.py: Added log when SD needs to auto-start

Now when user asks to generate an image:
1. Tool shows as "running" immediately (spinner)
2. Backend logs show SD startup progress every 10s
3. Tool updates to "complete" with result when done
