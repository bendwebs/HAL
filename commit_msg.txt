fix: don't send base64 image data to LLM in tool results

The generated_image result was including full base64 image data
(500KB-1MB per image) in the tool result sent back to the LLM.
This caused timeouts/errors in the second LLM call.

Now we sanitize the tool result before sending to LLM:
- Remove base64 data from generated_image results
- Send only metadata (success, prompt, dimensions, seed)
- The full result with images is still sent to frontend via action_complete

This keeps the LLM context reasonable while preserving the full
image data for frontend rendering.
