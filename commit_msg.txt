fix: return SD service result directly, add debug logging

The _execute_tool was creating a new result object instead of
using the service's result which already had the correct structure.
This caused the 'type: generated_image' to potentially be lost.

Now we return the service result directly and added debug logging
to track what's being sent in action_complete.
